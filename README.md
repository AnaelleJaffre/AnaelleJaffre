âœ¨ _Hi_ âœ¨.
-

Coding is not my whole life, but I do like to create some things sometimes, mostly in CSS with keyframes just for fun.

I also code in C#, and make 3D, cause these times I'm pretty interested in creating games on Unity in C# ðŸ‘¾.

Also, I made a blog for my best friend :) you can find it [here](https://alexianarbonne.github.io/blog-de-traduction/ "The blog of Alexia"). And soon, I'll also create my artist portfolio. You can still  [check it here](https://amonshage.artstation.com/ "My current ugly portfolio..."), even though I currently am offended of its design.
