Coding is not my whole life, but I do like to create some things sometimes, mostly in CSS with keyframes just for fun.

I also code in C#, and make 3D, cause these times I'm pretty interested in creating games on Unity in C# ðŸ‘¾.

I'm an artist so I created a small portfolio : âœ¨[tadaaa]âœ¨(https://anaellejaffre.github.io/amonshage/ "My artist portfolio") (but it's actually bad code, it was just for fun).

Also, I made a blog for my best friend :) you can find it [here](https://alexianarbonne.github.io/blog-de-traduction/ "The blog of Alexia").
