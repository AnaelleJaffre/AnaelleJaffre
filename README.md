Hello :D
---

I'm Anaelle and I just love galettes bretonnes. Because they're âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨.

Also I like to code. Mostly in CSS with keyframes and funny stuff. Because I'm an artist ðŸ˜±. I know I know, don't hate me, I mean I prefere maths than art but, you know.

Yeah anyways, I also code in C#, and make 3D, cause these times I'm pretty interested in creating games on Unity in C# ðŸ‘¾(and also because my engineering school teaches us C#)(ironically).

I'm currently creating a blog for my best friend :) you can find it [here](https://alexianarbonne.github.io/blog-de-traduction/ "The blog of Alexia"). And soon, I'll also create my artist portfolio. You can still  [check it here](https://amonshage.artstation.com/ "My current ugly portfolio..."), even though I currently am offended of its design.

Can that thing work ?
