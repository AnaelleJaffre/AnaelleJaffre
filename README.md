EH SALUT YOU're âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨.
-

I like to code. Mostly in CSS with keyframes. Because I'm an artist ðŸ˜±.

I also code in C#, and make 3D, cause these times I'm pretty interested in creating games on Unity in C# ðŸ‘¾.

Few months ago I made a blog for my best friend :) you can find it [here](https://alexianarbonne.github.io/blog-de-traduction/ "The blog of Alexia"). And soon, I'll also create my artist portfolio. You can still  [check it here](https://amonshage.artstation.com/ "My current ugly portfolio..."), even though I currently am offended of its design.

And I tried to add my stats like my friends but this operation shamefully failed, as you can admirabely observe it right there :
